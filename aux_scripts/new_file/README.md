Scripts in this folder should be placed in `<scripts_folder>/new_file/`. They will be run every time when the first segment of a new source file is activated.

## `reportNewFile.groovy`

Pops up a dialog window reporting that a new source file was activated. Works better than the one in `entry_activated`.
