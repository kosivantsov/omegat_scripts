Files located in this folder should be placed into `<scripts_folder>/application_startup`. They will be executed each time OmegaT is started.

## `scriptingWindow.groovy`

This script opens OmegaT Scripting window after the main window is loaded.

## `unlock_cursor.groovy`

This script sets text cursor to UNLOCK which makes it possible to get outside of the current target text field without clicking. The same is achieved by pressing **F2**, but automatically on startup.
